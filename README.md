# CloudWatch Application Signals for Lambda demo

> It seems to be based on OpenTelemetry and currently supports Python and Node.js runtimes, but does it also work with Node.js functions using ECMAScript modules (ESM)? â€” the documentation doesn't tell ðŸ¤” â€” [Niko Virtala at Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/nikovirtala.io/post/3lbig3dxmhs24)

From the function logs we can see how the module is loaded â€” please note `.mjs` (Module JavaScript):

```
--import 'data:text/javascript,import { register } from "node:module"; import { pathToFileURL } from "node:url"; register("%40opentelemetry/instrumentation/hook.mjs", pathToFileURL("./"));'
```

The answer is yes â€” it works with Node.js functions using ES modules!
